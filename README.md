# WagerWise

A basketball and football tool for deciding which props and parlays are worth betting, built
around the apps in your rotation: PrizePicks, Underdog, Sleeper, Real and Winible for pick'em, FanDuel
as the one sportsbook, and ProphetX and Polymarket.

Sportsbook bets and parlays are only ever recommended at FanDuel. Pinnacle, BetOnline, LowVig,
DraftKings and the rest are pulled to price the market and never shown as the place to bet.
Add a book under Settings if you open an account there.

Two tabs: **NBA** and **NFL**, with the NBA the one the board is built for. **College football
rides inside the NFL tab**, off by default: turn the switch on under Settings → Today and one press
pulls both, each priced with its own numbers, with a college row badged CFB wherever it appears —
and because that press costs 80 credits rather than 56, the button asks before spending it. Each tab
keeps its own cached pull, so switching never throws away a slate you already paid feed credits for.

The NHL was removed. Nothing pulls or prices it; a logged NHL entry still reads back off a
screenshot and still settles, because its stats are hockey's and a read that forgot that would
silently type them as basketball.

**It does not create an edge. It stops you acting on edges that are not there.**

That is the whole design brief. A projection built from season averages, compared against a
line the market has already priced, will happily report a fifteen percent edge that is
entirely an artefact of a thin input. This app refuses to produce that number.

Five things:

1. **Refuses to price what it cannot verify.** A prop with no sportsbook price behind it is
   marked unpriced, shown for context, and excluded from every expected-value calculation
   and from the optimizer. No exceptions.
2. **Captures the payout off your screen.** Stored payout tables drift. The multiplier the
   app displays while you build the entry is ground truth, so you read it in and confirm it
   before anything is priced, and it is stored with the slip.
3. **Prints the break-even hit rate beside every expected value.** If the break-even does
   not look like a plausible per-leg number, the multiplier is wrong and the expected value
   beside it is fiction.
4. **Shops the line and models correlation.** The same opinion is worth more on the app with
   the better number, and same-game legs are not independent.
5. **Keeps you honest.** Logs what the model predicted against what happened. This is the
   only part that can tell you the model is wrong.

Everything runs in your browser. No account, no database, no telemetry.

**Two feeds can price the slate.** [The Odds API](https://the-odds-api.com) carries Pinnacle's
player props and bills per market per game against 500 credits a month.
[PropLine](https://prop-line.com) bills per request against 1,000 a day and also carries the
lines **PrizePicks and Underdog are actually posting**. Pick the provider under Settings → Odds
feed. A PropLine key also works alongside The Odds API: Pinnacle prices the props, PropLine
supplies the pick'em apps' lines, and the pick'em entry is built at the line your app shows.

## Running it

**Node 22 or newer is required.** Check with `node -v`; if it says v20 or lower, install the
current LTS from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (or `nvm install 22`, since `.nvmrc` pins it).
Node 20 reached end of life in April 2026 and no longer gets security fixes, so npm is set to
stop with an `EBADENGINE` error rather than install on it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingbobbywhite-blip/wagerwise.git
cd wagerwise
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3000**, pick a league tab, and press **Get today's picks**.

`npm ci` installs exactly the versions in `package-lock.json`, the ones CI has checked, and
never rewrites that file. `npm audit` should report 0 vulnerabilities.

The dev server only answers on this computer (127.0.0.1). It holds any key in `.env.local`,
so other devices on your Wi-Fi are kept out. To open it from your phone on the same network
anyway, start it with `npx next dev -H 0.0.0.0`, and only on a network you trust.

### Updating an existing clone

```bash
git pull origin main
npm ci
npm run dev
```

If a pull aborts with "Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten" and
names `package-lock.json`, an `npm install` rewrote it. Nothing in it is worth keeping, so
discard it and retry:

```bash
git checkout -- package-lock.json && git pull origin main
```

If `npm ci` reports packages that are not in `package.json` (Supabase, for example), or
anything else odd, the `node_modules` directory is stale. Wipe and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules && npm ci
```

### Deploying

`main` is the production branch. With Vercel's Git integration connected, every push to
`main` deploys itself; otherwise deploy by hand from a clone:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Leave `ODDS_API_KEY` unset in Vercel unless the deployment is password-protected. A public
URL with a server-side key lets anyone who finds it spend your feed quota. Entering the key
in Settings instead keeps it in your own browser.

The feed routes only answer JSON requests from the app's own pages, so another website open
in your browser cannot spend a key held in `.env.local` through your local server. That does
not protect a public URL from someone calling it directly, which is why the advice above
stands.

### The API key

The app needs sportsbook prices. Get a key from
[the-odds-api.com](https://the-odds-api.com) (the free tier is 500 requests a month).

The simplest place for it is **Settings → Odds feed** in the running app: paste it there and
it is kept in your browser. To keep it in a file instead, copy the example file and put the
**real key** after the `=` in a text editor:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local        # Windows: copy .env.example .env.local
```

Restart the app after editing `.env.local` so it picks the key up; a key there takes
precedence over one in Settings. Avoid `echo KEY=... > .env.local` in Windows
PowerShell 5: it writes the file as UTF-16, and the key in it is never read. Without a
working key the app has no prices, and it will say so rather than invent an edge.

Optionally add a [PropLine](https://prop-line.com) key (free, 1,000 requests a day) to read the
pick'em apps' own lines, or to price the whole slate from PropLine instead. It goes in the
same Settings tab, or on the `PROPLINE_API_KEY=` line of `.env.local`.

The same caution about public deployments applies: leave `PROPLINE_API_KEY` unset on an
unprotected URL and enter the key in Settings instead.

**"PropLine rejected the API key"** means PropLine received a key and did not recognise it,
so the fix is the key itself, not the app. The message names where the key it sent came
from. Three things cause it:

- The key is wrong, revoked, or from somewhere else. Check it against the one on
  [prop-line.com](https://prop-line.com); an Odds API key is not a PropLine key, and the two
  fields in Settings are not interchangeable.
- `PROPLINE_API_KEY` in `.env.local` holds something stale, and it takes precedence over
  Settings, so retyping the key in Settings changes nothing. Correct it in the file, or
  delete the line and restart. A placeholder such as `your_api_key` is ignored rather than
  sent, so it can no longer shadow a real key in Settings.
- The key was pasted with a newline or wrapping quotes. Those are stripped now, but the
  PowerShell 5 UTF-16 trap above still applies.

```bash
npm test         # 644 unit tests over the probability engine, the feeds and screenshot reading
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## What you get, every day

Pick a league, press one button, and the app pulls today's games, prices every player prop
it can, and produces three things:

**Best single bets.** Offers where one book is priced better than the sharp consensus of
the others. The book being judged is always excluded from the consensus that judges it,
and at least one market-making book has to remain, otherwise a room full of copycats
becomes its own reference. Each row shows the price, the fair price, the edge and a
stake sized by fractional Kelly.

**Best parlays.** Built only from legs that are individually positive expected value,
and only within a single book, because a leg at DraftKings cannot be combined with a leg
at FanDuel onto one ticket. Correlation between legs is priced rather than ignored.

**Pick'em entry.** The likeliest targets that clear the bar: one leg per player, at most two
per game, with the chance they all hit and the expected return at your default app's payout
table. If too few clear, it says so rather than padding the entry with coin flips.

**Every line on the card is the app's own, or none of them is.** An entry is built at your
default app's real lines, read through PropLine, or at the books' lines when the pull carried
none of the app's — never at a mixture of the two. This is the one rule here worth stating on its
own, because the mixture is what it used to do: a target whose line never arrived went in at the
sportsbooks' number with a small grey label, on a card headed with the app's name and a payout
table whose expectation multiplies every leg's chance at the line beside it. The reasoning was
that a line we never heard about is not the same as one the app is not offering, which is true
and is still not a line anyone can place. In practice about half a card's lines were not the
app's, and nothing on the card told you which half.

So a prop with no line from the app is left out, whichever reason it has, and both reasons are
counted under the card: how many the app covers and is not posting, and how many its lines never
reached at all. They lead to different next steps — the first is not playable there, the second is
worth a look on your own screen — so they are never merged into one number. With no PropLine key
at all, the books' line is all there is, and the card says it is the number to go and look for
rather than one the app is known to be posting.

**Pick'em targets.** With a PropLine key, the lines PrizePicks and Underdog are posting are
listed under each player with the chance of each side, priced off the sportsbooks, and your
default app's line is filled in. The table leads with the chance at the line you can actually
play and names which line that is, so the app's number and the books' number are never shown as
one; where they differ, both appear. A line the app posted a while ago says how old it is, since
the apps move them and a stale reading is a guess about the present. Without a key, nothing here
can see what the apps are offering, so type in the line your app shows.

Either way you get one answer: the over, the under, or pass. Never both. Value bets likewise show
one side per player and stat: an over at one book and an under at another is a middle, not two
picks, and on a pick'em app one of the two always loses.

Nothing is fetched until you press the button, and the result is cached, because player
props are billed per market per game and a page refresh that silently re-pulls the slate
is a refresh that costs money.

## Getting more data in

The daily pull covers the common markets automatically. These paths exist for when you
want something it does not pull, or want to work off a DFS board directly.

### Your own screenshots

Screenshot the board on your phone and drop the images into **Capture**. OCR runs entirely
in this browser, using a bundled engine and language model, so nothing is uploaded and no
app is scraped. Scraping a pick'em app's endpoints violates their terms and gets accounts
restricted, and the board is the half that carries no information anyway: it tells you what
is on offer, not what it is worth.

Capture the fifteen or so props you would genuinely consider rather than the whole board.
Every row lands in a review table and has to be ticked off by eye before it can be loaded,
and a shorter list gets checked properly.

You can also paste CSV, TSV, JSON, or plain text copied off a board.

After reviewing the rows, press **Attach sportsbook odds** to price them. Props that get a
price become priced; everything else stays unpriced and cannot be built into an entry.

### Feed settings worth knowing

Put Pinnacle first in the book list and keep `eu` in the regions, because Pinnacle sits in
that region and leaving it out silently removes the most useful price on the board.

Player props are billed **per market per game**. Four markets across a twelve-game slate is
48 credits for one refresh, so the free tier is about ten refreshes a month. Narrow the
market list rather than the book list: books are free, markets are not.

| Column (for pasted data) | Matters |
| --- | --- |
| `player`, `market`, `line` | Required. The line is the number your app is offering. |
| `book`, `over_odds`, `under_odds`, `book_line` | Without these the prop is unpriced. |
| `game_log`, `minutes_log` | Per-game values. Used only when no price exists. |
| `rest_days`, `teammates_out`, `projected_minutes` | Minutes context for the no-odds path. |
| `app`, `game_id`, `team`, `opponent` | Enables line shopping and same-game correlation. |

## The one number worth internalising

The per-leg hit rate you need just to break even, summed across every paying tier:

| Entry | Top pays | Break-even per leg | All-hit shortcut would say |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Power 2-pick | 3x | 57.7% | 57.7% |
| Power 3-pick | 6x | 55.0% | 55.0% |
| Power 4-pick | 10x | 56.2% | 56.2% |
| Power 5-pick | 20x | 54.9% | 54.9% |
| Power 6-pick | 37.5x | 54.7% | 54.7% |
| Flex 3-pick | 2.25x | **59.1%** | 76.3% |
| Flex 4-pick | 5x | **56.9%** | 66.9% |
| Flex 5-pick | 10x | **54.3%** | 63.1% |
| Flex 6-pick | 25x | **54.2%** | 58.5% |

A 55% leg is a losing bet on most of these. "I hit 60% of my picks" is not the same as being
profitable, and a two-pick is the hardest of them all to beat.

These are standard picks. Goblins and demons change every tier: a real 6-pick flex of five
goblins and a demon hit five of six and paid **0.5x**, where the table above pays 2x. That is
why the tracker scores a logged entry at what the app actually paid, not at a table.

The right-hand column is what you get by raising the top multiplier to the power of minus
one over n, which is the shortcut almost every parlay calculator uses. It is correct for
all-or-nothing entries and wildly wrong for anything with partial-payout tiers, because it
ignores every dollar the lower tiers return. On a 3-pick flex it overstates the bar by
seventeen points, which is more than enough to talk you out of entries that are fine.

## Documentation

- [`docs/METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) — how every number is computed.
- [`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md) — what this cannot do, and where it can
  mislead you. Read this one before betting real money.

## Legal and practical

Sports betting and daily fantasy are regulated differently in every jurisdiction and are
not legal everywhere. Payout tables shipped here are **unverified defaults** and change
without notice. Nothing here is financial advice, and no model makes a negative-expectation
market profitable by itself.

## A name is not an identity

Across 130 college teams, two different players sharing a normalised name in one slate is
ordinary rather than freakish. Every map in the app used to be keyed on the name alone, which
fused them: six books pooled into one consensus and a line that was wrong for both. Player
identity is now name **and game**, in the quote grouping, the one-decision-per-prop rule, the
optimizer's one-leg-per-player constraint, the board's row grouping and the pick'em entry. The
same name in two games is also no longer the same player to the correlation model, where it was
pricing two unrelated legs as one event.

The pick'em lines still match by name, because they arrive from a different feed than the prices
and the two spell teams differently — but a line from the same fixture wins, matched on team
nicknames, and when a name is shared and no line can be tied to the fixture, nothing is shown and
the row says why. An imported board carries a name and a stat with usually no fixture, so there
the ambiguity is reported rather than resolved.

## What gets left out, and why you can see it

Three things are kept out of the pick'em section, and every one of them is counted and nameable
on screen:

**Props too lopsided for a board.** A flat payout table only works if both sides of a pick are
plausible, so an app does not post a prop whose favoured side is a near-certainty however happily
a sportsbook prices one. The ceiling is a dial in Settings (default 80%), what it removes is
listed by name under the targets with the reason, and a line PropLine shows an app actually
posting is never removed by it.

**Lines no board shows.** The thresholds and the probability ladder cover the lines the books are
actually hanging, widened half a standard deviation, instead of sweeping a fixed window around the
projection.

**Props your app has no line for.** Once a pull carries your app's own lines, a target without one
is out of the entry, because an entry is never built at a line the app may not be posting. The
count under the card splits the two reasons apart: the app covers that game and market and is not
posting this prop, or its lines never reached the prop at all. Coverage is judged per market
rather than per game, because an app covering a game says nothing about which stats it covers in
it — PrizePicks will post points for every starter in a game and no rebounds line in it anywhere,
and keyed on the game alone every one of those rebounds props read as "offered, and this player is
not on it", which is a different claim from the truth. The props are still in the table below at
the books' line, to check against your screen.

## The path to fitting the priors

Three numbers in this app are reasoned rather than measured, and they are labelled as such
wherever they appear: the kickoff widening (4% of variance per day), college football's volatility
multiplier (1.2) and the yardage spread floors. Fitting them needs data the app now collects.

**The tracker reads settled legs along three axes**, not one: by predicted probability band as
before, and now by competition and by market. Each row prints the variance multiplier that would
reconcile what the model said with what happened — the number to move the outcome-spread slider
toward. One axis at a time on purpose: competition by market by probability band is thirty cells
and a hundred settled legs would put five results in each.

That readout **cannot fit the kickoff widening**, and says so. A settled leg's stored probability
already had the widening applied, so comparing it to the result measures what is left after the
correction rather than the correction itself.

**What can fit it is the line history.** Each pull keeps one compact row per prop — the consensus
line, the implied mean and how many books posted it, about 190 bytes, not a copy of the quotes —
and the same prop seen twice at different distances from kick-off gives the spread of the move,
which is exactly the uncertainty the widening prices. The tracker prints the measured variance per
day beside the 4% in use, and counts its pairs out loud rather than quietly fitting six of them.

**It measures hours, not days, and that is a real limit.** Today pulls from local midnight to 11am
tomorrow, so a Sunday afternoon game cannot be pulled on Saturday at all: two looks at one prop can
be hours to about a day apart, never the four days a midweek NFL line actually drifts over. What
the readout shows is the last day's movement scaled to a day, which is a lower bound on the week's.
Closing that gap means a wider pull window, which means more games and more credits per press — a
choice for whoever is paying, not a default worth slipping in.

Legs logged before a competition was recorded sit in their own row. A leg keeps no game and no
start time, so nothing can work out afterwards whether it was a college prop or an NFL one, and
folding them into a guess would report college legs as NFL calibration.

## When the browser runs out of room

Everything lives in one localStorage blob, and a 14-game NFL pull at eight books is comfortably
over a megabyte of JSON — enough that a full Sunday could already fail to save. Until now it
failed **silently** on the one screen that causes it: the slate lived in React state, looked fine,
and was gone on the next reload along with the credits that bought it.

A failed save now sheds load instead, cheapest first — older line history, then another league's
slate, then the rest of the history, then the imported board — and says what it dropped, in a
banner in the header that every screen shows. Slips are never dropped: they are the only record of
what the model predicted.

## Leagues

| | NBA | NFL | CFB |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tab | NBA | NFL | inside NFL, opt-in |
| Feed sport key | `basketball_nba` | `americanfootball_nfl` | `americanfootball_ncaaf` |
| Markets, per-market feed | pts, reb, ast, 3pm, pra | pass yds, rush yds, rec yds, receptions | same as the NFL |
| Markets, per-request feed | the whole board: 14 | same four | same as the NFL |
| Default game cap | 14 | 14 | 6 |
| Volatility prior | baseline | its own markets | +20% on the NFL's (unfitted) |
| One default press | 70 credits | 56 credits | +24, and +1 to rank them |

**How wide a press asks is a question about billing.** The Odds API charges markets × games, so
its market list is a budget: the NBA's five put a full 14-game night at 70 credits, 14% of a
500-request month, which is under the share that makes the button stop and ask. PropLine charges
one request per game whatever the list, so the same budget buys nothing there — on PropLine the
NBA pulls its whole board, fourteen markets for the price of four. Every market left out is a
pick'em line that could have been read and was not, and since an entry is built only at lines an
app is really posting, a market nobody asked for is a leg you cannot play.

The rest of the NBA board, free on PropLine and addable under Settings → Markets on The Odds API:
pts+reb, pts+ast, reb+ast, steals, blocks, steals+blocks, turnovers, field goals made, free
throws made. The combos carry their components, so the correlation model prices PRA against PTS
for one player properly rather than as unrelated stats, and the entry's one-leg-per-player rule
already stops both riding together.

The **prior mean** is used only when no book has priced the prop: a real market price always
wins. A **volatility prior** above baseline widens the distribution, which pulls probabilities
toward a coin flip — the honest response to a less predictable league.

The WNBA and the NHL were both removed, and both still read back. A phone that still has one
selected opens on the NBA, a cache stored under it is dropped on load, and a settled entry in the
tracker still reads off a screenshot and still settles. The NHL needs more care than the WNBA did:
a WNBA screen's "Points" really is the basketball market, while an NHL screen's "Points",
"Assists" and "Blocked Shots" are different stats with different spreads, so the screenshot reader
still recognises an NHL screen and the log form still offers the league. Nothing prices it, which
the form says.

The NFL uses its own markets rather than scaled basketball ones. Yardage is modelled as a
right-skewed count (a 70-yard catch happens, a minus-70 one does not), with a spread near 70
yards on a 250-yard passing line, near 29 on a 65-yard rushing line and near 31 on a 60-yard
receiving line. Passing touchdowns and interceptions are less variable than a Poisson count.
Touchdowns, completions, attempts, carries, interceptions and rush + rec yards are all mapped;
add their feed keys under Settings → Markets to pull them. Anytime and first-touchdown props are
yes/no prices with no line and are not modelled.

The probability at a line a book has actually priced is identical in every league. That is
deliberate and there is a test pinning it: when the market has spoken, a league prior that
moved the number would be inventing an edge.

### NFL notes

Most days have no NFL games. The slate is Sunday, plus Thursday and Monday nights, and the
Today screen names the next game when today has none. Props are posted days ahead and move
hard on injury and weather news, so pull on game day. A full Sunday at the default four
markets is about 56 credits, plus 24 for the college games pulled with it, and the Today screen
shows that total before you press the button.

Two things make the numbers here more honest than a dispersion ratio alone:

**The button asks before an expensive press.** Above 15% of a 500-request month — 75 credits, six
presses from an empty month — the pull is a confirm rather than a note beside the button, because a
note is read after the credits are gone. The figure is summed per competition, since each can be
asked for a different market list and credits are billed per market per game. A full Sunday with
college football switched on is 80 credits, so that press asks; the NFL alone, at 56, does not.

**Yardage carries a floor on its relative spread.** A ratio prior implies that the spread
grows with the square root of the projection, so a 340-yard passing line came out with a
standard deviation of 80 yards — 24% of the mean, where a real passing line sits near 28%.
Every probability built on that was too confident, and an overconfident probability is a
phantom edge. Passing, rushing, receiving and rush+rec yards now get the wider of the ratio
prior and a floor of 27%, 45%, 52% and 45% of the projection. Below the crossover the ratio
still governs, because a low-volume receiver really is more erratic than a proportional
spread allows.

**A line priced days before kickoff is widened for the days in between.** Four percent of
variance a day, capped at twelve percent. The price was right for what was known on Tuesday;
what Sunday's injury report will say is real uncertainty and belongs in the distribution
rather than in a footnote. On a slate pulled the same evening it changes nothing.

The feed does not say which team a player is on. A quarterback and his own receiver are
therefore linked only as players in the same game, not as a stack, so the correlation between
them is understated for same-team legs and overstated for opponents.

### College football notes

CFB is a companion of the NFL tab, not a tab of its own: same sport, same markets, same
weekend, and the pick'em apps put both on one board. It is pulled in the same press, capped at
six games because a Saturday lists fifty and only the televised ones carry real prop pricing,
and priced with its own numbers rather than the NFL's:

- **20% wider at the same projected mean.** The talent gap between the two rosters is often
  enormous, starters sit out the fourth quarter of a blowout, and the backfield split is far
  less knowable than in the NFL. All three widen the outcome, and a wider outcome means a
  probability closer to a coin flip.
- **Its own plausibility ceilings**, because a 500-yard passing game and a 300-yard rushing
  game both happen in college football and NFL ceilings would flag real outcomes as impossible.

**Which six games get the cap is chosen, not taken in start order.** A Saturday lists fifty and
the earliest kick-off is as likely to be a game no book prices as the one everyone does, so one
sport-level call for spreads — billed per market per region, so a single credit whatever it
returns — says who the books are actually pricing. Games are ranked by how many books hang a
spread, ties to the closer game, and anything over 21 points is skipped because a four-touchdown
favourite benches the players a yardage prop is on. That is also why the section asks for all four
football markets rather than a trimmed pair: the games it selects are the televised ones, which are
exactly the games where receptions and receiving yards exist. If the ranking call fails the slate
falls back to start order and says so, and what it did is reported on screen so a thin board reads
as expected rather than broken.

Most of a Saturday slate comes back unpriced and is correctly left out: no sportsbook price,
no expected value, no exceptions.

### Why the NHL was dropped, and what the board kept from it

The NHL was here because it is where a pick'em app's even-money payout is most often wrong:
small counts on half-point lines, where the books price one side well past a coin flip and the
app pays it as if it were even. That is a real effect and it was not enough. The pick'em apps
post a thin slice of the hockey board, the starting goalie is confirmed too late to price saves
with any confidence, and every credit and every hour spent on it was one not spent on the NBA,
which posts more props, prices them deeper, and runs most nights of the week.

Two failures were found there first, and both were general. Both are now pinned on the NBA,
because they bite on any low-count market — blocks, steals and threes hit the same arithmetic as
shots and points:

1. **Markets no pick'em app posts.** A prop priced at 0.5 against a mean near 0.25 makes the
   favoured side an 80% under. Sorted by hit rate, those came out on top of the board. No pick'em
   app offers a prop that lopsided — the payout table only works if both sides are plausible — so
   a target whose every posted line is more lopsided than 80/20 is dropped from the pick'em
   section, counted, and named on screen rather than silently missing. The value-bet side of the
   app still prices it: a lopsided price is still a price, and still worth betting if it is wrong.
   A line PropLine shows an app really posting is never removed this way, because the ceiling is a
   prior about what a board offers and a real line beats a prior.
2. **Lines no board has ever shown.** The thresholds and the probability ladder used to sweep a
   fixed window around the projection, which gave a 0.4-mean market lines up to 16.5 and a
   27-point scorer lines down at 11.5. The search now covers the lines the books are actually
   hanging, widened half a standard deviation for an app that hangs a slightly different number.
   The same fix cuts a 250-yard passing ladder from two hundred rows to fifty.

Hockey markets stay in the taxonomy — shots on goal, goalie saves, hockey points, assists, goals,
blocked shots, power-play points — and are read as hockey whenever an entry is an NHL one. That is
the whole of what remains: enough to read and settle what is already logged, and nothing that
spends a credit.

College basketball and the WNBA were removed. A phone that still has one selected opens on
the NBA.
