# WagerWise

An NBA-only tool for deciding which props and parlays are worth betting, built around the
apps in your rotation: PrizePicks, Underdog, Sleeper, Dabble, Chalkboard, Winible, Real,
ProphetX and Polymarket.

**It does not create an edge. It stops you acting on edges that are not there.**

That is the whole design brief. A projection built from season averages, compared against a
line the market has already priced, will happily report a fifteen percent edge that is
entirely an artefact of a thin input. This app refuses to produce that number.

Five things:

1. **Refuses to price what it cannot verify.** A prop with no sportsbook price behind it is
   marked unpriced, shown for context, and excluded from every expected-value calculation
   and from the optimizer. No exceptions.
2. **Captures the payout off your screen.** Stored payout tables drift. The multiplier the
   app displays while you build the entry is ground truth, so you read it in and confirm it
   before anything is priced, and it is stored with the slip.
3. **Prints the break-even hit rate beside every expected value.** If the break-even does
   not look like a plausible per-leg number, the multiplier is wrong and the expected value
   beside it is fiction.
4. **Shops the line and models correlation.** The same opinion is worth more on the app with
   the better number, and same-game legs are not independent.
5. **Keeps you honest.** Logs what the model predicted against what happened. This is the
   only part that can tell you the model is wrong.

Everything runs in your browser. No account, no database, no telemetry.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
npm test         # 136 unit tests over the probability engine
npm run build
```

## Getting data in

Two halves, and they are not equally important.

### The offer side: your own screenshots

Screenshot the board on your phone and drop the images into **Capture**. OCR runs entirely
in this browser, using a bundled engine and language model, so nothing is uploaded and no
app is scraped. Scraping a pick'em app's endpoints violates their terms and gets accounts
restricted, and the board is the half that carries no information anyway: it tells you what
is on offer, not what it is worth.

Capture the fifteen or so props you would genuinely consider rather than the whole board.
Every row lands in a review table and has to be ticked off by eye before it can be loaded,
and a shorter list gets checked properly.

You can also paste CSV, TSV, JSON, or plain text copied off a board.

### The signal side: a real odds feed

Add a key from [the-odds-api.com](https://the-odds-api.com) in **Settings**, then press
**Attach sportsbook odds** on the capture screen. Props that get a price become priced;
everything else stays unpriced and cannot be built into an entry.

This is the part worth paying for. Put Pinnacle first in the book list and keep `eu` in the
regions, because Pinnacle sits in that region and leaving it out silently removes the most
useful price on the board. Player props are billed per market per event, so narrow the
market list to what is actually on your board.

| Column (for pasted data) | Matters |
| --- | --- |
| `player`, `market`, `line` | Required. The line is the number your app is offering. |
| `book`, `over_odds`, `under_odds`, `book_line` | Without these the prop is unpriced. |
| `game_log`, `minutes_log` | Per-game values. Used only when no price exists. |
| `rest_days`, `teammates_out`, `projected_minutes` | Minutes context for the no-odds path. |
| `app`, `game_id`, `team`, `opponent` | Enables line shopping and same-game correlation. |

## The one number worth internalising

The per-leg hit rate you need just to break even, summed across every paying tier:

| Entry | Top pays | Break-even per leg | All-hit shortcut would say |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Power 2-pick | 3x | 57.7% | 57.7% |
| Power 3-pick | 5x | 58.5% | 58.5% |
| Power 4-pick | 10x | 56.2% | 56.2% |
| Power 5-pick | 20x | 54.9% | 54.9% |
| Power 6-pick | 37.5x | 54.7% | 54.7% |
| Flex 3-pick | 2.25x | **59.1%** | 76.3% |
| Flex 4-pick | 5x | **56.9%** | 66.9% |
| Flex 5-pick | 10x | **54.3%** | 63.1% |
| Flex 6-pick | 25x | **54.2%** | 58.5% |

A 55% leg is a losing bet on most of these. "I hit 60% of my picks" is not the same as being
profitable, and a three-pick is harder to beat than a six-pick.

The right-hand column is what you get by raising the top multiplier to the power of minus
one over n, which is the shortcut almost every parlay calculator uses. It is correct for
all-or-nothing entries and wildly wrong for anything with partial-payout tiers, because it
ignores every dollar the lower tiers return. On a 3-pick flex it overstates the bar by
seventeen points, which is more than enough to talk you out of entries that are fine.

## Legal and practical

Sports betting and daily fantasy are regulated differently in every jurisdiction and are
not legal everywhere. Payout tables shipped here are **unverified defaults** and change
without notice. Nothing here is financial advice, and no model makes a negative-expectation
market profitable by itself.
