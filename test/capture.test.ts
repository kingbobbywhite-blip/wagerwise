/**
 * Capture-a-slate regression tests.
 *
 * The fixtures are real Tesseract output, not hand-written text: three phone
 * screenshots of rendered boards, run through the same segmentation mode and
 * block walk as lib/ocr/engine.ts, positions included. They pin the two
 * failures that made capture return nothing, or worse, the wrong thing:
 *
 *   - SINGLE_BLOCK segmentation merged grid columns and dropped every line
 *     value, so a PrizePicks screenshot produced zero props.
 *   - AUTO segmentation fixed that but emits a list board's right-aligned values
 *     after all the names, so pairing by output order pinned each value to the
 *     wrong player. Pairing by position fixes it.
 *
 * Every assertion is on the full set, so a wrong pairing fails as loudly as a
 * missing one.
