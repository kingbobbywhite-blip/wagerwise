 *
 *   - A player who does not play ("Reboot") does not refund the entry. The entry
 *     shrinks to the remaining picks and pays that size's table, so a 3-pick
 *     with one win, one loss and one no-show is a 2-pick with a loss: a loss.
 *     The tracker only knew the 3-pick payout, so it refunded it.
 *   - Entries placed straight in the app could not be logged at all, and they
 *     are most of what gets played.
 *   - The same player sat in two open entries, so one bad game cost both.
