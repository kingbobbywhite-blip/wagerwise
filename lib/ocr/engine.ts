/**
 * Page segmentation mode, and the single most important setting in this file.
 *
 * tesseract.js defaults to SINGLE_BLOCK (6), unlike the Tesseract CLI, which
 * defaults to AUTO (3). SINGLE_BLOCK assumes one column of evenly sized text,
 * and a pick'em board is neither:
 *
 *   - PrizePicks lays cards out in a two-column grid. SINGLE_BLOCK reads straight
 *     across both, so "LeBron James" and "Stephen Curry" come out as one
 *     four-word line that is neither name.
 *   - The line value is the largest text on the card, around three times the
 *     size of everything else. SINGLE_BLOCK treats it as noise and drops it, so
 *     no prop can be formed at all, whatever the parser does afterwards.
 *
 * AUTO runs Tesseract's own layout analysis. It finds each card as its own
 * block and emits one card at a time, left column then right, with the line
 * value intact. Measured on a rendered two-column board: SINGLE_BLOCK gave 11
 * lines and zero line values; AUTO gave 25 lines and all four.
 *
 * SPARSE_TEXT (11) also recovers every value but interleaves the columns,
 * which pairs the wrong name with the wrong line. Do not use it here.
