 * Goblins and demons, found by colour.

 * PrizePicks marks a boosted pick with a small face beside its line: a green
 * goblin (an easier line that pays less) or a red demon (a harder one that
 * pays more). Text recognition cannot tell them apart; both come out as "O",
 * "W" or "@". Their colours can: nothing else in the line box is that green
 * or that red. And it matters: on fifteen real entries, goblins hit 16 of 19
 * while standard picks went 4 of 13, and the payout was cut to match.
 *
 * The face sits in the line box at the right of the leg's row, just left of
 * the arrow and the value. So for each OCR line that ends in a number, look
 * in that band of the row for saturated green or red. Rows a progress bar
 * crosses are skipped: a bar is coloured all the way across, a face is not.
