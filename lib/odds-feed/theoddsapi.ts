/**

 * per-event cost as "[number of unique markets RETURNED] x [number of
 * regions]", and one worked example says a request for five markets where only
 * two carry data costs two. If that is right, asking a thin college game for
 * four markets and getting two back costs two, and trimming a market list
 * saves nothing in credits at all.
 *
 * It could not be confirmed against the vendor's own documentation, which this
 * environment cannot reach: the egress policy answers 403 for that host, and
 * routing around a policy denial is not on. What IS confirmed, from the
 * vendor's own sample code, is the SHAPE of the cost — markets x regions, with
 * no per-event term on the sport-level endpoint, which is what makes the depth
 * ranking below affordable.
 *
 * How to settle it in one pull: make the same per-event request twice, once
 * including a market the game does not post and once without, and compare the
 * x-requests-last response header. Until someone does, nothing here should
 * claim the saving as a fact. No decision in the app rests on it either way:
 * market lists are trimmed because an unpriced prop is a worse board, and that
 * is true whatever the billing turns out to be.
