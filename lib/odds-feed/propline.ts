 * price toward a coin flip, which is exactly the error this app exists to
 * stop. So pick'em rows are split out here and never reach the pricing path.

 * The pick'em lines something on this slate can actually read, and the ones

 *
 * Every pull is kept in this browser's storage, which is the app's binding
 * constraint, so a line no code path can ever reach is worth shedding. The
 * trap is that "can ever reach" is two different things, and keeping only the
 * first loses real information:
 *
 *   A line is PLAYABLE only if its own player and market were priced. A line
 *   reaches a board row through one key, `player|market` (see
 *   indexPickemLines), so a PrizePicks rebounds line for a player the books
 *   priced only for points can never attach to a target. It used to be kept
 *   anyway, on the strength of the points quote.
 *
 *   But a line is also EVIDENCE that the app covers a game and market, read
 *   under `game|market` (see pickemCoverage), and that evidence decides
 *   whether a prop with no line reads as "the app is not offering it" or as
 *   "we never heard". That reading is made for OTHER players' props, so a line
 *   can be unplayable itself and still be the only thing that gets another
 *   row's verdict right. Drop it and the screen says "no PrizePicks line
 *   reached at all" about a game and market where PrizePicks did post one and
 *   this app threw it away — the one failure this codebase exists to refuse.
 *
 * So: keep a line when its own player and market are priced, OR when its
 * market is priced for anyone in a game the line can be attributed to. The
 * second clause is exact rather than cautious for both paths above: coverage
 * for `game|market` is only ever read by a target at that same game and
 * market, so a line whose market is priced nowhere in its game is unreachable
 * by either.
 *
 * It is NOT lossless for a third consumer, and that is worth stating rather
 * than glossing. The Today screen reads the stored lines once more, keyed on
 * the app alone, to say which apps turned up in a pull; by that key a shed
 * line is a line the app never posted, and an app whose every line was shed
 * read as "posted none in this pull" — contradicted by the shed-lines note in
 * the same paragraph. The route therefore reports the apps that posted BEFORE
 * this filter runs (pickemAppsPosted), which is what that question actually
 * asks. Any new consumer keyed on something other than `player|market` or
 * `game|market` has to be checked against this the same way.
