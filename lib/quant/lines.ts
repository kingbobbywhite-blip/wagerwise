/**
 * Line history, and the one honest way to fit the kickoff widening.
 *
 * A football prop is posted days before kick-off and moves on injury,
 * depth-chart and weather news. The app answers that by widening the
 * distribution by a fixed 4% of variance per day, capped at 12%, which is a
 * number somebody reasoned out rather than measured. What would measure it is
 * the same prop's line seen twice: once days out and once near kick-off. The
 * spread of that movement IS the uncertainty the factor is trying to price,
 * because what the factor really says is "we do not yet know what the line
 * will be when the game starts".
 *
 * Two things this cannot do, and does not pretend to:
 *
 *   It cannot be fitted from the tracker's hit rates. A settled leg's
 *   predicted probability already had the widening applied, so comparing it to
 *   what happened measures what is LEFT after the correction, not the
 *   correction. Only two observations of the same line are independent of it.
 *
 *   It cannot make the second observation happen. Nothing in this app re-pulls
 *   a slate near kick-off: refreshing costs credits and the cache exists to
 *   avoid it. So a pair needs the same slate pulled twice, and the readout
 *   counts its pairs out loud rather than quietly fitting six of them.
 *
 *   And the gap it can see is HOURS, not days. The Today screen pulls from
 *   local midnight to 11am tomorrow, so a Sunday afternoon game cannot be
 *   pulled on Saturday at all: the furthest apart two looks at one prop can be
 *   is a few hours to a day, depending on kick-off. The multi-day drift the
 *   NFL is famous for would need a wider window than Today uses, which means
 *   more games and more credits per press — a choice for whoever is paying,
 *   not a default to slip in. What is measured here is the last day's
 *   movement, extrapolated per day, and it is a lower bound on the week's.
