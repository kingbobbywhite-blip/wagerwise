 * one is left out — including one the app's lines simply never reached.
 *
 * It used to fall back to the books' line for exactly that case, reasoning

 * line anyone can place: the card is headed with an app's name and a payout
 * table, and the expectation printed under it multiplies every leg's chance at
 * the line beside it. A leg at a number the app may not be posting makes that
 * number fiction, which is the one thing this app exists to refuse. In
 * practice it was most of the entry — half the lines on a PrizePicks card were
 * not PrizePicks lines — and there is no way to tell from the card which half.
 *
 * So the honest answer is a shorter entry, or none, and a count of what was
 * left out and why. Without any lines from the app, the books' line is all
 * there is and is still useful: it is the number to go and look for, and the
 * screen says that rather than claiming the app posts it.
