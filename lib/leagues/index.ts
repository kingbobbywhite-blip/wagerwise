/**
 * League configuration.
 *
 * Everything that differs between leagues lives here, so adding one is mostly
 * a data change rather than a code change. The engine itself is league-agnostic:
 * it prices a distribution against a line, and a line is a line whoever posted it.
 *
 * What genuinely differs is the SHAPE of the distribution, and it differs for
 * reasons worth stating rather than fudging:
 *
 *   Volatility. The same projected mean deserves a wider distribution, and
 *   therefore a probability closer to 50%, in a league where usage is less
 *   predictable. That is dispersionScale.
 *
 *   A different sport (NFL). Football markets are their own stats with their
 *   own spreads (see lib/nba/markets), so the NFL needs no scaling of the
 *   basketball numbers: its scales are 1 and its markets are its own.
 *
 *   Market depth. The NBA has props on every book at every game. The NFL is the
 *   deepest prop market there is, but posts a week ahead and moves hard on
 *   injury news. College football is priced for the games on television and
 *   barely at all for the rest. Asking for markets a league does not post is at
 *   best a wasted request and may be a wasted credit.
 *
 * COMPANIONS. A league can carry other competitions that are pulled in the
 * same press and priced in the same tables, because they are the same sport
 * played the same week: college football sits inside the NFL section. A
 * companion keeps its own priors, caps and game cap, so a CFB prop is never
 * priced with NFL numbers. See `competitionsFor`.

 * read an entry that was already logged. Settled history is the only thing in
 * this app that can tell you the model was wrong, so dropping the hockey
 * reading would quietly destroy the only evidence worth keeping.
 *
 * This matters more for hockey than it did for the WNBA. A WNBA screen's
 * "Points" really is the basketball market, so forgetting the league costs
 * nothing. An NHL screen's "Points", "Assists" and "Blocked Shots" are
 * different stats with different spreads, and read as basketball they would be
 * silently mis-typed. Hence a retired league keeps its sport, and nothing else.
