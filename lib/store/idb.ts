/**
 * Persistence in IndexedDB, one record per part of the state.
 *
 * localStorage was the wrong place for this app's data, and a real NBA pull
 * proved it: the whole PropLine board is eleven-plus markets across every game
 * at every book, verbatim, and that does not fit in localStorage's ~5MiB on
 * an iPhone even with nothing beside it. The save failed, the shedding ran out
 * of other things to drop, and the last thing it dropped was the pull itself —
 * from the screen as well as from storage, so a pull that succeeded read as
 * "Nothing pulled yet". IndexedDB is metered against the device's disk rather
 * than a fixed 5MiB, so a full slate fits with room to spare.
 *
 * Split into parts because the parts change at very different rates. Settings
 * change on every keystroke in a form; a slate changes once a pull. Written as
 * one blob, every keystroke re-serialised megabytes of quotes. Written as
 * parts, only what changed is written, and a part too big to store fails on
 * its own instead of taking the settings and slips down with it.
