/**
 * Progressively smaller versions of the state, for when storage is full.
 *
 * This is not hypothetical. One 14-game NFL pull at eight books is roughly
 * 1,100 props x 8 quotes x ~320 bytes, which is 2.8MB of JSON; browsers meter
 * localStorage in UTF-16 code units, so that is over 5MiB of a ~5MiB quota
 * before an NBA or NFL cache sits beside it. A pull can therefore fail to save
 * at all, and until now it failed silently on the one screen that causes it:
 * the slate lived in React state, looked fine, and vanished on reload along
 * with the feed credits that bought it.
 *
 * So a failed save sheds load rather than giving up, oldest and cheapest
 * first, and says what it dropped. The order is deliberate: line history is
 * research and can be thinned, another league's slate is yesterday's problem,
 * and the pull you just paid for is the last thing to go. Slips are never
 * dropped — they are the only record of what the model got right.
 *
 * What is shed is shed from the STORED copy only. It used to be shed from the
 * state on screen as well, and on a slate too big to store on its own the
 * last step dropped the pull that had just come in: the pull succeeded, its
 * warnings showed, and the screen said "Nothing pulled yet". Only used now
 * where IndexedDB cannot be opened; see saveReduced.
