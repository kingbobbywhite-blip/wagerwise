/**
 * Today's slate with player prop prices attached, for any supported league.
 *
 * This is the endpoint behind the one-screen experience: it works out which
 * games tip today in the caller's own timezone, pulls player props for those
 * games only, and hands back normalised quotes.
 *
 * Cost control matters more here than anywhere else in the app. Player props
 * are billed per market per event, so a careless call across every market and
 * every game will empty a monthly quota in a handful of refreshes. The defaults
 * are four markets, and the response reports what the call cost and what is
 * left.
 *
 * Two feeds can price the slate. The Odds API bills per market per game against
 * a monthly quota. PropLine bills per request against a daily one, and its
 * payload also carries the pick'em apps' own lines, which are split out and
 * returned separately: they say what the apps offer, never what a pick is worth.
